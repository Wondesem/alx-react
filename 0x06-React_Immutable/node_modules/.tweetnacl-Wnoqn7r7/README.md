Overview
--------

The primary goal of this project is to produce a translation of TweetNaCl to
JavaScript which is as close as possible to the original C implementation, plus
a thin layer of idiomatic high-level API on top of it.

There are two versions, you can use either of them:

* `nacl.js` is the port of TweetNaCl with minimum differences from the
  original + high-level API.

* `nacl-fast.js` is like `nacl.js`, but with some functions replaced with
  faster versions.


Installation
------------

You can install TweetNaCl.js via a package manager:

[Bower](http://bower.io):

    $ bower install tweetnacl

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):

    $ npm install tweetnacl

or [download source code](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/releases).


Usage
-----

All API functions accept and return bytes as `Uint8Array`s.  If you need to
encode or decode strings, use functions from
<https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-util-js> or one of the more robust codec
packages.

In Node.js v4 and later `Buffer` objects are backed by `Uint8Array`s, so you
can freely pass them to TweetNaCl.js functions as arguments. The returned
objects are still `Uint8Array`s, so if you need `Buffer`s, you'll have to
convert them manually; make sure to convert using copying: `new Buffer(array)`,
instead of sharing: `new Buffer(array.buffer)`, because some functions return
subarrays of their buffers.


### Public-key authenticated encryption (box)

Implements *curve25519-xsalsa20-poly1305*.

#### nacl.box.keyPair()

Generates a new random key pair for box and returns it as an object with
`publicKey` and `secretKey` members:

    {
       publicKey: ...,  // Uint8Array with 32-byte public key
       secretKey: ...   // Uint8Array with 32-byte secret key
    }


#### nacl.box.keyPair.fromSecretKey(secretKey)

Returns a key pair for box with public key corresponding to the given secret
key.

#### nacl.box(message, nonce, theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Encrypt and authenticates message using peer's public key, our secret key, and
the given nonce, which must be unique for each distinct message for a key pair.

Returns an encrypted and authenticated message, which is
`nacl.box.overheadLength` longer than the original message.

#### nacl.box.open(box, nonce, theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Authenticates and decrypts the given box with peer's public key, our secret
key, and the given nonce.

Returns the original message, or `false` if authentication fails.

#### nacl.box.before(theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Returns a precomputed shared key which can be used in `nacl.box.after` and
`nacl.box.open.after`.

#### nacl.box.after(message, nonce, sharedKey)

Same as `nacl.box`, but uses a shared key precomputed with `nacl.box.before`.

#### nacl.box.open.after(box, nonce, sharedKey)

Same as `nacl.box.open`, but uses a shared key precomputed with `nacl.box.before`.

#### nacl.box.publicKeyLength = 32

Length of public key in bytes.

#### nacl.box.secretKeyLength = 32

Length of secret key in bytes.

#### nacl.box.sharedKeyLength = 32

Length of precomputed shared key in bytes.

#### nacl.box.nonceLength = 24

Length of nonce in bytes.

#### nacl.box.overheadLength = 16

Length of overhead added to box compared to original message.


### Secret-key authenticated encryption (secretbox)

Implements *xsalsa20-poly1305*.

#### nacl.secretbox(message, nonce,
